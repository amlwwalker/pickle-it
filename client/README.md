# Workhorse Client

The client is a command line interface into the Workhorse framework. Its main use is for building out features and testing them manually from the command line using the array of flags available, however it maybe used as an interface for Workhorse if so wished.

# To do

- The client needs to have a flag option for each possible setting available and will continue to be the first developed interface when features are added.

- The client only watches files past to it, not files in the database. This should be considered as to wether that is the way we want it to act
